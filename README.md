# Vision Basics - Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains **Computer Vision beginner projects** built with OpenCV.  
These projects are mainly for **learning, research, and experimentation** with basic image processing techniques.

## 🟢 Project Descriptions

### 1. **Canny Edge Detection**
**File:** `canny_edge_detection.py`  
Detects edges in an image using the **Canny Edge Detection** algorithm.  
Useful for: detecting boundaries and preparing images for further processing.

### 2. **Contour Detection**
**File:** `contour_detection.py`  
Detects contours (shapes) in an image.  
Shows how to filter, draw, and analyze contours.

### 3. **Corner Detection**
**File:** `corner_detection.py`  
Finds corners in images using methods like **Harris Corner Detection**.  
Good for feature detection in images.

### 4. **Shape Detection**
**File:** `shape_detection.py`  
Recognizes basic geometric shapes (circle, triangle, rectangle) in images.

### 5. **Pixel Operations**
**File:** `pixel_operations.py`  
Demonstrates operations on pixels: changing colors, grayscale conversion, and basic pixel manipulations.

### 6. **Image Difference**
**File:** `image_difference.py`  
Calculates differences between two images and highlights the changed areas.

### 7. **Image Rotation**
**File:** `image_rotation.py`  
Rotates images by a given angle while preserving quality.

### 8. **Image Merging**
**File:** `image_merging.py`  
Merges two images together. Useful for creating composite images or overlays.

### 9. **Canvas Creation**
**File:** `canvas_creation.py`  
Creates a blank canvas for drawing and testing other algorithms.
